## üí° Short description
This project uses an ESP8266 with attached LCD-Display to connect to the local API of the Tesla Powerwall (V2). It is displaying all the current power flows (grid, home, solar, battery) and the SOC (state of charge).

## üéà Showcase

<p align="center">(This is the main screen.)</p>


## ‚öô Features
- [Main screen](#-showcase) includes:
    - SOC (state of charge)
    - Four different power flows (grid, home, solar, battery)
- Power flows are formatted in an organized manner. No overlapping will happen, units of values are converted to properly fit and look nice. :-)
- Indicator (dot in upper right corner) for the current API request status

For more information on all the different screens have a look at [this wiki-page](https://github.com/MoritzLerch/pv_display/wiki/Different-screens).

## üëæ Installation and Usage

- You can find a **quick start guide and documentation** [here](https://github.com/MoritzLerch/pv_display/wiki). Have fun in the Wiki!
